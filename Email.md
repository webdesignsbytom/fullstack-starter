# Email

These DNS records tell receiving mail servers that your emails are legitimate and authorized by your domain.

1. SPF (Sender Policy Framework): Specifies which mail servers are allowed to send email on behalf of your domain.

2. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): Adds a digital signature to your emails so the receiving server can verify they haven't been tampered with.

3. DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance): Tells receiving servers how to handle messages that fail SPF/DKIM checks.

## How to verify email address

1. Google Postmaster

- Add your sending domain to Postmaster Tools
- Sign in to Postmaster Tools.
- In the bottom right, click Add Add.
- In the Getting started window, enter the domain used to authenticate your outgoing email with SPF, or DKIM, or both. If you use different domains for SPF and DKIM authentication, you only need to enter one of these domains.
- Click Next to open the Verify your domain window.


✅ 1. Set Up SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
SPF tells recipient servers which IPs are allowed to send email for your domain.

In cPanel:

Go to Email Deliverability.

Find your domain and "Manage".

Ensure there's an SPF record that includes:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
v=spf1 +a +mx +ip4:<your server IP> include:inmotionhosting.com ~all
Replace <your server IP> with your cPanel mail server’s IP. You can usually find it in the same panel.

✅ 2. Set Up DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
DKIM adds a digital signature to your emails.

Still under Email Deliverability in cPanel:

Click Manage for your domain.

Enable or fix the DKIM record.

Example DKIM (should be autogenerated by cPanel):

cpp
Copy
Edit
default._domainkey.yourdomain.com
✅ 3. Set Up DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
DMARC tells recipients what to do if SPF/DKIM fails.

Add a TXT record in DNS:

sql
Copy
Edit
Name: _dmarc.yourdomain.com
Type: TXT
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:your@email.com; ruf=mailto:your@email.com; sp=none; aspf=r;
Later, once you're confident SPF and DKIM are passing, change p=none to p=quarantine or p=reject.

✅ 4. Check Reverse DNS (PTR Record)
Make sure your server’s IP has a reverse DNS (PTR) record pointing to your domain.

Contact InMotion support to set this up if you’re unsure.

✅ 5. Have a Custom ‘From’ Name and Address
Use a real-sounding name like:

sql
Copy
Edit
From: Your Company <info@yourdomain.com>
Avoid generic or shady-looking names like “no-reply” or “admin123”.

✅ 6. Use a Branded Email Signature
This improves trust and makes your messages look legitimate.

✅ 7. Avoid Spammy Keywords and Formatting
In your actual email content:

Avoid excessive caps, red text, or large fonts.

Don't use trigger words like “Buy now!”, “100% free”, “Click here”.

Use a healthy balance of text to images.

Always include a clear unsubscribe link (even in manual newsletters).

✅ 8. Test with Mail-Tester.com or GlockApps
Send a test email to https://www.mail-tester.com — they’ll give you a score out of 10 and explain exactly what’s wrong.

✅ 9. Use a Static IP for Sending Email
Dynamic IPs are often blacklisted. Ask your hosting provider to confirm you're using a dedicated/static IP for sending email.

✅ 10. Warm Up Your Email Reputation
If the domain is new:

Don’t blast emails right away.

Start with small, personal sends to known contacts.

Gradually increase volume.

✅ 11. Monitor Blacklists
Check if your domain or IP is blacklisted:

https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx

If blacklisted, follow their instructions to delist.

If you still hit spam, check mail-tester.com with your email content.
